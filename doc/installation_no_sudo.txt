INSTALLATION WITHOUT SUDO RIGHTS for SINGULARITY USERS
This file is meant to give guidance to SINGULARITY users that do not have sudo rights. DOCKER users are not affected, as sudo rights are not needed at installation time.

Please run the install process as explained in the main README file until you are asked:
  $ “To complete the installation, you need SUPERUSER rights and INTERNET access."
  $ "Do you want to proceed? [y|n]"
Answer no (i.e., “n”), then, depending on your Singularity version, follow the instructions below to complete the installation. Installation without sudo for Docker users is not supported at present.
