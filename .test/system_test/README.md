# SYSTEM TESTS

**WARNING: you might RUN OUT OF RESOURCES while running some of these tests.**

Running MONET on some of the file contained in the input folder might fail on commodity hardware (i.e., a regular laptop or desktop) as about 8GB or RAM need to be available. In that case, you can allocate a larger SWAP partition (on Linux) or run the experiment on more powerful hardware, such as a server. Please browser the contents of MONET/test/system_test/reproduce_challenge to view the exact RAM usage (ram_usage.txt).
