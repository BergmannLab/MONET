# BENCHMARKING MONET

This directory contains the scripts that were used to benchmark MONET on a wide variety of networks. The user is free to use it as he or she best sees fit. This is research software, provided "as is" and will not be supported and troubleshooted as part of the MONET toolbox.
This directory also contains a copy of "Weighted Directed Nets", a tool by Andrea Lancichinetti that was used to generate the benchmark networks. We acknowledge and thank him and his collaborators.
